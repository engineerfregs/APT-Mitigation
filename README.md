# APT-Mitigation
The amalgamation of APT simulation, vulnerability assessment, and analysis of detection mechanisms yields invaluable insights into the evolving threat landscape within cloud ecosystems
ABSTRACT
The rapid advancement in cloud computing technology is in a constant state of evolution with threat actors continuously refining their tactics, exploiting new vulnerabilities, and expanding their scope of influence. This dynamic environment exposes it to a range of emerging cyber-attacks, including Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) impacting both customers and service providers. The need for researchers to understand the gap in the literature regarding APT detection has become crucial. In response to this urgent need, this thesis investigates the impact of Advanced Persistent Threats in cloud environments and proposes effective mitigation strategies. The research aims to comprehensively understand APTs' influence on cloud security, analyse existing approaches, emulate APT adversary plans, simulate attacks using Mitre Caldera, employ Snort for detection and utilize Nessus Vulnerability scanning tool. The study answers critical questions about APTs' exploitation of cloud environments, strengths, and weaknesses of mitigation methods, impacts of successful APT attacks, vulnerabilities in cloud infrastructures, and techniques for detecting APTs. 
In synthesis, the research findings underscore the intricate interplay between APT activities and cloud environments, emphasizing the exigency for robust detection and mitigation strategies. The amalgamation of APT simulation, vulnerability assessment, and analysis of detection mechanisms yields invaluable insights into the evolving threat landscape within cloud ecosystems. With organizations increasingly embracing cloud technologies, the lessons derived from this study substantially contribute to the ongoing discourse on fortifying cloud security against persistent and evolving cyber threats.
